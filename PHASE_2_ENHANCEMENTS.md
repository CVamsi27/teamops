# Phase 2 Enhancements - Task Assignment Features

**Date Completed:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  

---

## Overview

This phase implements critical enhancements to the task assignment system including notifications, permission controls, and workload visualization. These features improve team collaboration and task management efficiency.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Assignee Change Notifications

**Purpose:** Keep team members informed when tasks are assigned or unassigned

**Backend Implementation:**
- **File:** `apps/api/src/modules/task/task.service.ts`
- **Trigger:** When `assigneeId` changes during task update or creation
- **Notifications Sent:**
  - New assignee: "Task Assigned: [Title]" - `${user} assigned [task] to you`
  - Old assignee: "Task Unassigned: [Title]" - `${user} unassigned [task] from you`
- **Data Included:**
  - Task ID and title
  - Name and ID of person who made the assignment
  - Timestamps
- **Smart Logic:**
  - Only notifies if assignee actually changes
  - Doesn't notify the user making the change
  - Handles both explicit assignment and default assignment cases

**Integration:**
- Uses existing `NotificationService` with WebSocket broadcast
- Notifications appear in real-time notification center
- Full assignee context included for user awareness

---

### 2. ✅ Permission Restrictions for Task Reassignment

**Purpose:** Ensure only authorized members can change task assignments

**Implementation Details:**
- **File:** `apps/api/src/modules/task/task.service.ts`
- **Permission Model:**
  - ✅ **LEAD** can reassign any task
  - ✅ **CONTRIBUTOR** can reassign any task
  - ❌ **REVIEWER** cannot reassign
  - ❌ **VIEWER** cannot reassign
- **Permission Check:**
  - Runs when `assigneeId` changes during task update
  - Validates user's project membership role
  - Checks before task update is applied
  - Throws `ForbiddenException` if unauthorized

**Code Example:**
```typescript
if (dto.assigneeId !== undefined && dto.assigneeId !== oldTask.assigneeId) {
  await this.checkReassignmentPermission(user.userId, oldTask.projectId!);
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "message": "Only LEAD and CONTRIBUTOR members can reassign tasks",
  "error": "Forbidden"
}
```

---

### 3. ✅ Workload Distribution View

**Purpose:** Visualize team workload across project members

**Backend - Task Service Method:**
```typescript
async getWorkloadDistribution(projectId: string)
```
- Returns array of objects with:
  - User info (id, name, email)
  - Total tasks assigned
  - Breakdown by status (TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE)

**Backend - API Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/tasks/workload/:projectId
```
- Returns complete workload data for all project members
- Includes members with zero tasks
- Sorted by total tasks count

**Frontend - Custom Hook:**
```typescript
useWorkloadDistribution(projectId: string)
```
- Query hook with React Query
- Automatic data fetching and caching
- Full Zod validation
- Error and loading states

**Frontend - Visual Component:**
`WorkloadDistributionView` displays:

1. **Member Cards** showing:
   - Name and email
   - Total task count badge
   - Member profile info

2. **Stacked Bar Chart** with:
   - Gray section = TODO tasks
   - Blue section = IN_PROGRESS tasks
   - Green section = DONE tasks
   - Task count labels on each segment
   - Proportional sizing based on task breakdown

3. **Status Legend:**
   - Color-coded boxes
   - Count for each status
   - Easy at-a-glance understanding

4. **Team Statistics:**
   - Total tasks across project
   - Number of team members
   - Average tasks per member

**Example Output:**
```
Team Workload Distribution

John Doe (john@example.com) - 5 tasks
[████ 2][████ 2][█ 1]          2 TODO, 2 In Progress, 1 Done

Sarah Smith (sarah@example.com) - 3 tasks
[███ 1][██ 1][████ 1]          1 TODO, 1 In Progress, 1 Done

Mike Jones (mike@example.com) - 2 tasks
[██ 1][██ 1]                   1 TODO, 0 In Progress, 1 Done

---
Total tasks: 10
Team members: 3
Avg tasks per member: 3.3
```

## Testing Guide

### Test 1: Notification on New Assignment
1. User A creates task
2. User A explicitly assigns to User B
3. ✅ User B receives "Task Assigned" notification
4. ✅ Notification shows task title and User A's name

### Test 2: Notification on Reassignment
1. Task assigned to User B
2. User A reassigns to User C
3. ✅ User C receives "Task Assigned" notification
4. ✅ User B receives "Task Unassigned" notification
5. ✅ User A doesn't receive notification

### Test 3: Permission Check - Allowed Roles
1. LEAD member edits task and changes assignee
2. ✅ Update succeeds
3. Contributor member does same
4. ✅ Update succeeds

### Test 4: Permission Check - Denied Roles
1. REVIEWER member tries to reassign task
2. ❌ Gets 403 Forbidden error
3. VIEWER member tries to reassign
4. ❌ Gets 403 Forbidden error

### Test 5: Workload Distribution
1. Open project with 3 members
2. Members have: 5, 3, 2 tasks respectively
3. Tasks distributed across TODO/IN_PROGRESS/DONE
4. ✅ Component shows correct counts
5. ✅ Bar chart shows correct proportions
6. ✅ Statistics show totals and averages

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Permission Model
- **Decision:** Use project membership roles for permission checking
- **Rationale:** Consistent with existing team/project structure
- **Implementation:** Check `ProjectMembership.role` before allowing reassignment

### 2. Notification Timing
- **Decision:** Notify async after task update
- **Rationale:** Non-blocking, ensures task updates complete
- **Benefit:** Better performance and reliability

### 3. Workload Calculation
- **Decision:** Calculate on-demand per project
- **Rationale:** Real-time data, avoids caching issues
- **Benefit:** Always shows current state

### 4. Frontend Hook Pattern
- **Decision:** Use React Query with Zod validation
- **Rationale:** Consistent with existing hooks
- **Benefit:** Type-safe, integrated caching

---

## Performance Considerations

### Workload Distribution Query
- **Complexity:** O(n + m) where n = tasks, m = members
- **Optimization:** One query per project (not per member)
- **Caching:** React Query auto-caches by projectId
- **Limit:** Good for projects < 1000 members

### Notification Performance
- **Async:** Notifications sent in background
- **No blocking:** Task update returns before notifications sent
- **Error handling:** Notification failures don't block task update

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential next phase items:
1. **Email Notifications** - Send emails for task assignments
2. **Notification Preferences** - Allow users to opt-in/out
3. **Workload Balancing** - Suggest optimal task assignments
4. **Performance Optimization** - Cache workload for large projects
5. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket push for workload changes
6. **Historical Analytics** - Track workload trends over time
