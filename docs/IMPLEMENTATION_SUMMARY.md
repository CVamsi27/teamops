# Implementation Summary: Global Roles & Project Members

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Global Role Enforcement ✅
**File**: `/apps/api/src/modules/team/team.controller.ts`
- Added permission check in `POST /teams` endpoint
- Only users with global `role = 'ADMIN'` can create teams
- Non-admin users receive `ForbiddenException` with message: "Only administrators can create teams"

### 2. Project Membership Model ✅
**File**: `/apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`
- New `ProjectMembership` model with:
  - `id` - UUID primary key
  - `role` - ProjectRole enum (LEAD, CONTRIBUTOR, REVIEWER, VIEWER)
  - `userId` - Foreign key to User
  - `projectId` - Foreign key to Project
  - Unique constraint on `[userId, projectId]`
  - Indexes on both foreign keys for fast lookups
- New `ProjectRole` enum with 4 levels
- Updated `Project` model with `memberships` relationship
- Updated `User` model with `projectMemberships` relationship

### 3. Repository Layer ✅
**File**: `/apps/api/src/modules/project/project-membership.repository.ts`
- `ProjectMembershipRepository` service for database operations
- Methods:
  - `create()` - Add member to project
  - `findByUserAndProject()` - Single membership lookup
  - `findAllByProjectId()` - List all project members
  - `findAllByProjectIdWithUser()` - List with user details
  - `updateRole()` - Change member role
  - `delete()` - Remove member

### 4. Service Layer ✅
**File**: `/apps/api/src/modules/project/project.service.ts`
- Enhanced `ProjectService` with member management methods
- New methods:
  - `getProjectMembers()` - View all project members (any member access)
  - `addProjectMember()` - Add member (LEAD only)
  - `updateProjectMemberRole()` - Update role (LEAD only)
  - `removeProjectMember()` - Remove member (LEAD only)
- Security features:
  - Access control enforcement
  - Membership verification
  - Last LEAD protection (can't remove only LEAD)
  - Duplicate member prevention

### 5. API Endpoints ✅
**File**: `/apps/api/src/modules/project/project.controller.ts`
- `GET /projects/:id/members` - List project members
- `POST /projects/:id/members/:userId` - Add member
  - Body: `{ role: ProjectRole }`
- `PATCH /projects/:id/members/:userId/role` - Update member role
  - Body: `{ role: ProjectRole }`
- `DELETE /projects/:id/members/:userId` - Remove member

### 6. API Schemas ✅
**File**: `/packages/api/src/schemas/project-membership.schema.ts`
- `ProjectRoleEnum` - Zod enum for project roles
- `ProjectMembershipSchema` - Full membership object
- `CreateProjectMembershipSchema` - Create validation
- `UpdateProjectMembershipSchema` - Update validation
- `AssignProjectRoleSchema` - Role assignment validation

### 7. Module Configuration ✅
**File**: `/apps/api/src/modules/project/project.module.ts`
- Added `ProjectMembershipRepository` to providers
- Exported for use in other modules

## Permission Hierarchy

```
Global Role (ADMIN, MEMBER, VIEWER)
    ↓
Team Role (ADMIN, MEMBER, VIEWER in each team)
    ↓
Project Role (LEAD, CONTRIBUTOR, REVIEWER, VIEWER in each project)
```

## Access Control

| Action | Who Can Do It | Location |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Create Team | ADMIN global role | TeamController.create() |
| Invite to Team | ADMIN/MEMBER in team | InviteController |
| Create Project | MEMBER+ global | ProjectController.create() |
| View Members | Any project member | ProjectController.getMembers() |
| Add Member | LEAD in project | ProjectController.addMember() |
| Change Role | LEAD in project | ProjectController.updateMemberRole() |
| Remove Member | LEAD in project | ProjectController.removeMember() |

## Key Features

### Security
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC) at every operation
- ✅ Membership verification before operations
- ✅ Last LEAD protection (can't create leaderless projects)
- ✅ Duplicate member prevention
- ✅ Cascading deletes (when project deleted, memberships deleted)

### Data Integrity
- ✅ Unique constraint on user-project combination
- ✅ Foreign key constraints
- ✅ Indexed lookups for performance
- ✅ Atomic operations

### API Quality
- ✅ Zod validation on all inputs
- ✅ Type-safe responses
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes (403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found)
- ✅ Clear error messages

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Global Role Check**
   ```bash
   # As non-ADMIN user, try to create team
   POST /teams
   # Should receive: 403 Forbidden - Only administrators can create teams
   ```

2. **Test Add Member**
   ```bash
   # As LEAD, add member to project
   POST /projects/proj-123/members/user-456
   Body: { "role": "CONTRIBUTOR" }
   # Should succeed with membership object
   ```

3. **Test Access Control**
   ```bash
   # As CONTRIBUTOR, try to add member
   POST /projects/proj-123/members/user-789
   # Should receive: 403 Forbidden - Only project leads can add members
   ```

4. **Test Last LEAD Protection**
   ```bash
   # Project has one LEAD (user-1)
   # Try to remove user-1 or change role
   DELETE /projects/proj-123/members/user-1
   # Should receive: 403 Forbidden - Cannot remove the last project lead
   ```

## Database Migration

To apply changes to an existing database:

```bash
cd apps/api

# Generate Prisma types
pnpm exec prisma generate

# Create migration
pnpm exec prisma migrate dev --name add-project-membership

# Or apply specific migration file
pnpm exec prisma migrate deploy
```

## Error Handling

Common error responses:

```json
// 403 - User doesn't have permission
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "message": "Only project leads can add members",
  "error": "Forbidden"
}

// 404 - Resource not found
{
  "statusCode": 404,
  "message": "User is not a member of this project",
  "error": "Not Found"
}

// 400 - Validation error
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Invalid project role",
  "error": "Bad Request"
}
```

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL or compatible database
- Prisma CLI

### Setup Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Generate Prisma Client
cd apps/api && pnpm exec prisma generate

# Run migrations
pnpm exec prisma migrate dev

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Data Migration** - Auto-add project creators as LEAD
2. **Invite System** - Send project invites
3. **Audit Logging** - Log all member changes
4. **Bulk Operations** - Add multiple members
5. **Role Templates** - Pre-defined role sets
6. **Frontend UI** - Member management UI components
