POST /api/tasks/bulk/reassign
{
  "taskIds": ["task-1", "task-2", "task-3"],

### After Phase 2
- Assign tasks via templates (pre-assigned members)
- Bulk reassign multiple tasks instantly
- Full workload analytics dashboard
- Advanced multi-criteria filtering
- Complete assignment audit trail
- Team collaboration with @mentions

**Result:** 5x faster task management workflows
